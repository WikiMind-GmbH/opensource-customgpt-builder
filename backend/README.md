## Libraries
In the docker containers, all the libraries will automatically be installed from the requirements.txt.

While we don't need to install anything locally to get the docker set up running, we still want a python virtual environment with all the requirements installed for intellisense completions in vscode.

## Backend config

Use pip to install the requirements.
